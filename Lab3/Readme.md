Comparative Analysis of Clustering Results
Based on the performance metrics from the script, K-Means produced slightly better-defined clusters for the Wine dataset. This is evidenced by its higher Silhouette Score (0.285 vs. 0.280) and a more accurate clustering when compared to the true labels, as shown by its higher Adjusted Rand Index (0.897 vs. 0.865).

Visually, the scatter plots for both algorithms are very similar, indicating that for this particular dataset, the cluster shapes and positioning are nearly identical. Both successfully separated the three classes of wine. The primary difference lies in the nature of the cluster centers: the K-Means centroids are calculated mean values (which may not be actual data points), whereas the K-Medoids centers are always actual data points from the dataset.

This leads to a general guideline for choosing between them:

K-Means is generally faster and performs well on datasets with well-defined, spherical clusters where the mean is a good representative of the center. It's often the default choice.

K-Medoids is preferable when the dataset contains significant outliers or when clusters are non-spherical. Because its centers (medoids) are actual data points, it is more robust to noise and can better represent clusters where a calculated mean would be a poor summary.
